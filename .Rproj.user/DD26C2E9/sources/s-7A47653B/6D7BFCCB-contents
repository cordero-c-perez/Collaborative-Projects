## Project Description

There are many methods for cluster analysis and typically applying these techniques is not very challenging. The challenging part is developing an intuition for the results seeing as the most widely used applications of cluster analysis are associated with unsupervised learning. This repository houses an ongoing series of projects, exploring these methods, with an aim to develop an intuition for the results. Some projects show techniques applied in a supervised learning context to explore the subtle differences between methods, however, most of the projects are focused on defending the findings to establish a "feel" for this type of analysis. There will typically be three files for each project; one will contain the code (**.R**), another will be markdown (**.Rmd**), and the last (**.md**) can be viewed directly in github. The (.md) file description includes the associated project description.

## Description of Files

#### iris_main.r
A script file containing the code used in the ".rmd" files. 

#### iris_main.rmd  
A markdown file with an output converted to ".md" for github viewer compatability.  

#### iris_main.md
Viewable output of iris_main.rmd file. This can be considered a supervised learning project with a commonly used dataset (iris) to explore distinctions between two techniques, **kmeans** and **hierarchical clustering**. Although this is not supervised learning in the traditional sense (i.e. building a model or classification algorithm) this project explores applying two methods in a supervised setting as the data has the correct cluster classification available (species) to check the results against. This is important for identifying the effectiveness of "single linkage" vs "complete linkage", etc. This specific dataset is used as there are only quantitative variables present and thus removes the trouble of creating a proper distance or dissimilarity matrix for mixed datasets (**explored in later projects for more interesting data**).

#### README.rmd
This file creates a README.md file for the repository.
